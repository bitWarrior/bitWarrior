### Welcome to Steve's (BitWarrior) GitHub Profile

✨ Welcome to my GitHub Profile ✨
- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on an open source HAL/S compiler (reference Personal Projects) 
- 🌱 I am currently experimenting with TensorFlow on NVIDIA Jetson
- 📫 Feel free to contect me: contact.bitWarrior@proton.me 

### Personal Projects
* Resnik - An open source compiler for NASA's HAL/S high-level language. The Space Shuttle Flight Software (FSW) was written in the HAL/S Language (repo will be released as a Public Repo as when its more mature)
* Homebrew 3D Printer – In collaboration with several friends, we designed and built our own 3D printer with improved motor drive precision than comparable commercial printers within the same price bracket
